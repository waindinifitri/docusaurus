| **SSL Certificates**                    | An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts information sent to the server using SSL technology. SSL, and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.         |
