| OCR                                  | Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast). OCR system will be integrated with Prisma Application. The scanned candidate’s CV and/or candidate’s document will be automatically generated in the qualifying form. Then, KAE needs to validate it before screening is processed by the operations team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
